### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to build my own web app for music collaboration, reviews and feedback for distributed teams.
   A long process it seems.

   But the tutorials over at <a href="https://www.learnenough.com"> Learn Enoughâ„¢ to Be Dangerous</a>  are an immense helpful      resource and @mhartl is an amazing teacher and mentor.
